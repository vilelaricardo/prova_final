                Gaudi
            </h2>
            <p>
                The voices of Barcelona blur in a mix of Spanish and Catalan in much the way Gaudi's work blurs the
                lines between architecture and artwork.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the tiled benches in Guell Park to the towers over Casa Mila and Casa Battló, I fell in love with
                Goudi's work on my first trip to Barcelona.

            <h2>
                Park Guell
            </h2>
            <p>
                The benches as Lizard fountain in Park Guell make up part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site know as,
                "The Works of Antonio Gaudi."
            </p>
            <p>
                The park features Gaudi's famous Lizard Fountain, as well as benches and other extraordinary examples of
                Gaudi's talent with tiles.

            <h2>Casa Batlló</h2>
            <p>
                The first time I strolled down the Passeig de Grácia (Catalan for the Promenade of Grace), I stopped in
                my tracks in front of Gaudi's Casa Batlló.
            </p>

            <p>
                The 'house,' wedged between two 'normal' buildings, looks more like a giant sculpture than any house l'd
                ever seen anywhere else.

            <h2>
                Casa Mila
            </h2>
            <p>
                A popular attraction in Barcelona, Casa Mila, also known as La Pedrera, is arguably one of the most
                famous buildings designed by Gaudi.
            </p>
            <p>
                The roof features a collection of chimneys and towers that like they'd fit right in as characters in a
                Dr. Suess book.
